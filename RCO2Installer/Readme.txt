Run "!RCO2Installer.cmd" to install RCO2

If you have RCO1, please run "!UninstallRCO1.cmd" before installing RCO2

IF and ONLY IF you are on a custom version of Windows that disables UAC, OR, you have disabled UAC yourself, instead run "uninstallrco1-nouac-READ-THE-README.cmd"

Whitelist C:\RClientOptimizer2 in your antivirus please! Do not know why defender freaks out so much...
